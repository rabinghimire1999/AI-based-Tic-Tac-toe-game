# Tic-Tac-toe
 Tic Tac Toe game using the minimax algorithm to implement AI in Python using the Pygame library is created.The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence. It is used to determine the best move for a player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally. In the case of Tic Tac Toe, the algorithm works by considering all possible moves and evaluating each move based on the resulting game state. It then chooses the move that leads to the best outcome for the player.
